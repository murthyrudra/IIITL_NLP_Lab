# Lab 05

Just like Google Colab, Amazon Studio Lab offers everyone an environment to open notebooks. Amazon Studio allows you to create Conda environments and then allows you to connect the environment to the notebooks as well. It even has fixed GPU runtime, and checkpointing so that your experiment progress can be saved. Before you are able to create an account, there is a wait list unfortunately. 

Please try creating your accounts with @iiitl.ac.in email ID. I will see if I can get them whitelisted.
